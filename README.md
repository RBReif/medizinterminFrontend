## Introduction

Medizintermin is an intermediary service to help patients and health care professionals to connect and to easily facilitate the otherwise tedious managment of appointments with automated matching and scheduling.

Patients can easily book their medical appointments with medizintermin. We consider a wide range of needs to find the perfect appointment. Patients receive individually calculated recommendations for e.g. checkups. Patients can edit, cancel and see details of their appointments and the respective health care professionals. They can calculate routes to the respective lcoation.

Health care professionals can offer available time slots to patients, can keep track of previous appointments and can easily manage their schedule and their daily appointments. E.g., they can take notes that get stored and they see important information about their patients.
